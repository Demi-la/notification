# Frontend Mentor - Notifications page solution

This is a solution to the [Notifications page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/notifications-page-DqK5QAmKbC). 



## Overview
 This is a notification page that shows if a notification has been read or not. if you click on the unread notification it will show that the notification is read and you can also click on read all and all the unread notification will disappear. I really learned a lot in this project and it really opened my eyes to new ways of solving problem.

### The challenge

Users will be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
